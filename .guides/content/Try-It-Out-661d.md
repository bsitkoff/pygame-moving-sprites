## Try It Out

Hit **Run** in the terminal to start `move.py`.

Try pressing the arrow keys. You'll notice some keys work — and some don't. That's intentional.

**While you explore, look for:**

- Which keys move the player?
- What happens at the edges of the screen?
- Find the two `# TODO` comments in the code — what do they ask you to add?

> *[TODO: insert free-text-auto assessment — "What does move.py currently do? What is missing based on the TODOs?"]*
