## Playtest and Reflect

Swap with a neighbor and play each other's games for 2 minutes.

**Give feedback on:**
- Is the player speed comfortable — not too fast, not too slow?
- Does the player stay on screen in a way that feels right?
- What would make this game more interesting?

**Reflect on your own work:**

What's one thing that was harder than you expected? What's one thing you're proud of?

> *[TODO: insert free-text-auto or free-text assessment — "What was challenging? What are you proud of?"]*
