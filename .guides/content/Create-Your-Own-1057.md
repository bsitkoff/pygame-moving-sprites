### 🖼️ Using Your Own Sprite

*Need a custom image? Here's the workflow — or rewatch the video from Lesson 1.*

1. Find an image that's **at least 80×80 pixels**
2. Open **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)**, resize to about 80×80, and download *(Squoosh can make images smaller but not bigger — always start with a large enough image)*
3. Upload to your `images/` folder in Codio
4. Update the `Actor` name in your code to match the filename (no extension)
