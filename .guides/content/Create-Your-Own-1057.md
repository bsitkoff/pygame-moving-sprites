## Create Your Own

Time to build your own moving sprite game in `tryit.py`.

### 🖼️ Using Your Own Sprite

*Need a custom image? Here's the workflow — or rewatch the video from Lesson 1.*

1. Find an image that's **at least 80×80 pixels**
2. Open **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)**, resize to about 80×80, and download *(Squoosh can make images smaller but not larger — start with a big enough image!)*
3. Upload the file to your `images/` folder in Codio
4. Update the `Actor('name')` in your code to match the filename (no `.png`)

### Requirements

Build a game in `tryit.py` that:

1. Has a **player sprite** that moves with the keyboard in all four directions
2. Has **boundary logic** so the player stays on screen (or wraps around)
3. Has **at least one other Actor** visible on screen
4. Uses **your own sprite** (not just `happy` and `alien`)

If you finish early: can you make one actor move on its own, without keyboard input?
